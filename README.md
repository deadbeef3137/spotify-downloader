## Prerequisites

We recommend installing a Python virtual environment with version 3.9. If you don't have Python 3.9 or a virtual environment manager installed, you can follow these steps:

1. Download and install Python 3.9 from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/).
2. Install a virtual environment manager. A popular option is \`virtualenv\`. To install \`virtualenv\`, you can use pip, the Python package manager:

```bash
pip install virtualenv
```

3. Create a new virtual environment with \`virtualenv\`:

```bash
virtualenv venv
```

4. Activate the virtual environment. In Windows, the command is:

```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
